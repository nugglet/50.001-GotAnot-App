# 50.001 Introduction to Information Systems and Programming Final Project: Got Anot?

Inventory Management Java Application for SUTD's resource system.
This application was coded in Java using Android Studio.

## What does this app do?

This application allows students to view the available resources provided/loaned by the school (e.g. resistors, wires, power drill, Raspberry Pi etc.),
and allows them to book the resources they need. This application is meant to help students do away with the hassle of going down to each of the labs to check for available resources. If the resource is not availble, students can send a request to order the item, which informs staff they need to restock the items.

The app also allows SUTD lab staff to be able to better manage their inventory and be alerted when there are items running out of stock.
